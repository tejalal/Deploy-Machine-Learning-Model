# Deploy Machine Learning Model
Contains the details of creating, training and deployment of SVC (Support Vector Classifier) for the classification of IRIS Flower dataset.

This post has four different parts.
- First we created the SVC(Support Vector Classifier) using Python and save the trained model
- Next, We use python Flask framework for creating the Web API through which we can pass the new input to the saved model and can predict the class.
- In the third part, we use Python to consume the Web API
- In the fourth part, we use JAVA to consume the Web API
